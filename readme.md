## TRAPPED.IO

Trapped.io is a reddit-based soundcloud link aggregator and extension of the /r/trap community. The site was built to be an easier way to listen to music posted on /r/trap, and to our internet radio station.

The site is built on the Laravel PHP framework. If you have something to add to the site, feel free to contribute!
